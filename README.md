## Instruction

If you like my template and want to integrate as your portfolio template than first clone the project

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mirsahib/MirFolio.git
```

Install dependencies. Make sure you already have [`nodejs`](https://nodejs.org/en/) & [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed in your system.

```bash
$ yarn install
```

Run it

```bash
$ yarn start
```

Finally change the `src/portfolio` file to your need.

## Emailjs Installation

To connect the contact form with my gmail account I use emailjs package to avoid writting any backend code and also to avoid spamming.If you want to integrate your [emailjs account](https://www.emailjs.com/) with this project than rename `.env.example` file to `.env` and change these environment variable to your need.

```
REACT_APP_SERVICE_ID=<your service id>
REACT_APP_TEMPLATE_ID=<your template id>
REACT_APP_USER_ID=<your user id>
```
